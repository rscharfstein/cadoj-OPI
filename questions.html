            <h4>Applying for jobs</h4>
            <p id="jobs1" class="faq-heading"><strong>What happens after I submit my application?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">Once the application period closes, we will review applications and select top candidates for interviews.</p>

            <h4>Civil Service Exams</h4>
            <p id="exam1" class="faq-heading"><strong>What are civil service exams?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">Civil service is a system established by the State of California to help ensure that the hiring process for government is competitive and fair. The system was established decades ago to prevent government employees from hiring their friends and relatives without merit.</p>
            <br>
            <p>State jobs with similar responsibilities and qualifications are grouped together and assigned a civil service title. The State uses exams to measure a potential candidate's qualification for a particular title—a list of eligible candidates is established for each title ranked by exam scores. For most State jobs, agencies are required to hire candidates who have taken and passed a civil service exam and appear on the list.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="exam2" class="faq-heading"><strong>Do I have to take a civil service exam?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">Most likely, since the majority of California Statement government jobs require applicants to take and pass a civil service examination in order be employed by the State. However, you can still apply for a job before you’ve taken an exam (although we recommend taking the exam first). Career Executive Assignments (CEAs) do not need to take a separate examination; the Statement of Qualifications is scored by a panel of judges and serves as the examination.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="exam3" class="faq-heading"><strong>How do I sign up for an exam?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">You can review and sign up for exams <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/careers/exams">here</a>. Be sure to take the examination for the civil service title associated with the position you're applying to. To make your life easier, within each of the specific OPII job descriptions listed on the Open Positions section, we have linked to the relevant exam that is required for that role.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="exam4" class="faq-heading"><strong>Are there specific qualifications for exams?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">Yes, there are certain education and experience requirements for each title and exam. When the filing period for an exam begins, the State will post a "bulletin." The bulletin will contain information on the qualifications you have to meet in order to take the exam. You may have to possess a certain type of degree, have a certain number of college credits in a particular subject, or have a certain number of years of career experience to qualify. Read these qualifications closely to ensure that you qualify before applying to take the exam. </p>
            <br>
            <p id="exam5" class="faq-heading"><strong>Does passing the exam guarantee that I will get a State job?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">No, passing a civil service exam does <u>not</u> guarantee employment with the State. After the results of the exam have been established, applicants who have passed are placed on a list ranked by their exam score. State agencies will contact candidates for interviews. Candidates must still interview for positions and meet any specific requirements an agency may have for a position, beyond the minimum qualifications. </p>
            <br>
            <p id="exam6" class="faq-heading"><strong>Can I apply for a State job before I take a civil service exam?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">Yes, you can apply for a State job before you’ve taken the exam! But, in order to be hired, you must pass the exam, so it is in your best interest to take the exam first.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="exam7" class="faq-heading"><strong>Where can I find more information on civil service exams?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">Exam filing schedules, Bulletins, and other information can be found on the California Attorney General's <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/careers/civil#examination"> website</a>.</p>

            <h4> Additional questions</h4>
            <p id="other1" class="faq-heading"><strong>What kinds of benefits does the State offer its employees?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">The State offers its employees health plans, accrued vacation and sick leave with rollover, paid time off for 12 State holidays, retirement and pension plans, and discounts on transportation, gym memberships, and a variety of other products and services. </p>
            <br>
            <p id="other2" class="faq-heading"><strong>How is the job located in both San Francisco and Sacramento?</strong></p>
            <p class="faq-answer">While the office is currently based in Sacramento, we recognize that some people may prefer to work and/or live in San Francisco. We have an office space in San Francisco as well, and it may be possible to work part-time from San Francisco.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="other3" class="faq-heading"><strong>What would I actually work on in the Office of Performance &amp; Innovation?</strong></p>
