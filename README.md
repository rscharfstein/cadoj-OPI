The code and formatting of this site is forked from [City of Austin Design, Technology, and Innovation Fellows](https://cityofaustin.github.io/innovation-fellows/), who forked it from [NYC Tech Jobs](http://www.nyc.gov/techjobs).

##Website Framework

The website is built on [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com), an extremely easy-to-use HTML/CSS/JS framework. We're also using form styling from the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/), and additional styling from the [CFPB Design Manual](https://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/).

##Use it for Your City or Government Agency!

The City of Austin and NYC (as do we!) want you to use or modify this website for your city or government agency. If you're GitHub-savvy, you can [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) or [NYC's repo](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/TechJobs) for your organization. If you just want to download the code as a ZIP file, click Download ZIP at the bottom of the right-hand navigation bar.
